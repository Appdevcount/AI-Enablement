By the end of this journey, you'll not only have conquered the basics of Python but also unlocked new horizons in software development. Whether you're diving into data analysis with pandas, exploring web development with Django, or venturing into machine learning with TensorFlow, Python provides a versatile toolkit.

Let's commence with the basics – the "Hello, World!" program.

**From the below code snippets, you can see the difference in syntax.**

**C#**
```
using System;

class Program
    static void Main()
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

**PYTHON**
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

**C# Structure**
**Python Simplicity**
**Coding Intent**
**Efficient Python Coding**
**Python Philosophy**

Moving on to classes, the backbone of object-oriented programming:

**C#**
```
using System;
namespace CSharpForPythonDevs.Classes

public class Student
    private string name;
    public Student(string name)
        this.name = name;
    public void SetName(string name)
        this.name = name;
    public string GetName()
        return name;
```

**PYTHON**
```
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def set_name(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
```

**Python's __init__ Method:**
**Attribute Access in Python:**
Python's __init__ method offers a streamlined approach to object initialization, while the language's flexibility simplifies attribute access without the formality of explicit getter and setter methods. This highlights Python's commitment to concise and readable code.

**C#**
```
namespace CSharpForPythonDevs.Interfaces

interface IReportable
    void GenerateReport();
```

**PYTHON**
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Reportable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_report(self):
        pass
```

**C# Interface vs. Python ABCs:**
- Declaration Distinction: C# employs the interface keyword, while Python opts for abstract base classes (ABCs).
- Common Objective: Both serve the common goal of enforcing method implementation in implementing classes.

Mastering the art of handling exceptions is crucial for writing robust and reliable code. In this section, we explore how both C# and Python address exceptional situations. Dive into the syntax and strategies employed by each language to gracefully handle errors, ensuring the resilience of your applications in the face of unexpected challenges.

**C#**
```
using System;
class ExceptionHandlingExample
    static void Main()
        try
            // Code that may throw an exception
        catch (ExceptionType1 ex1)
            // Handle ExceptionType1
        catch (ExceptionType2 ex2)
            // Handle ExceptionType2
        finally
            // Code that always executes,
            //whether an exception is thrown or not
```

**PYTHON**
```
class ExceptionHandlingExample:
    def main(self):
        try:
            # Code that may throw an exception
        except ExceptionType1 as ex1:
            # Handle ExceptionType1
        except ExceptionType2 as ex2:
            # Handle ExceptionType2
        finally:
            # Code that always executes,
            #whether an exception is thrown or not
```

**C# try-catch Blocks:**  
Similar to Java, C# relies on try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.
- Multiple Catch Blocks: C# allows the use of multiple catch blocks, each tailored to handle a specific type of exception.
- finally Block: The finally block in C# ensures code execution regardless of exceptions.

**Python try-except Blocks:**  
Python adopts try-except blocks for handling exceptions effectively.
- Multiple Except Blocks: Python supports multiple except blocks.
- finally Block: Python's counterpart guarantees code execution irrespective of exceptions.

Both languages support custom exception creation.

**C#**
```
throw new CustomException("This is a custom exception.");
```

**PYTHON**
```
raise CustomException("This is a custom exception.")
```

**Exception Filters (C#):**  
In C#, exception filters enhance precision by allowing selective catching:
```
catch (Exception ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("specific"));
```

C# provides a tailored approach to resilience, while Python embraces EAFP ("it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission").

Explore Python's approach to generics and lambdas, drawing parallels with C#:

**Generics in Python**
```
class GenericContainer:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
container = GenericContainer(42)
```
**Lambdas in Python:**
```
add = lambda a, b: a + b
result = add(3, 5)
```

Python's dynamic typing.

Dive into Python's expressive string manipulation:

```
greeting = "Hello"
name = "John"
message = f"{greeting}, {name}!"
print(message) # Output: "Hello, John!"
```

**F-Strings in Python:**  
**String Manipulation in Python:**

Compare collections in Python and C#:

**Python List**
```
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
```

**C# List**
```
using System.Collections.Generic;
List<string> fruits = new List<string> { "Apple", "Banana", "Orange" };
```

**List Comprehensions in Python:**

Explore Python frameworks and libraries, akin to C#'s ecosystem:

**Flask (Web Development)**
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

**Rich Ecosystem for Data Science**
**Versatility of Python**
**Community Support**

Engage in hands-on projects to reinforce your Python skills:

```
class PythonProgram:
    def main(self):
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print("Original Numbers:")
        self.print_numbers(numbers)
        numbers = [num + 10 for num in numbers]
        print("\nNumbers after Adding 10:")
        self.print_numbers(numbers)
    def print_numbers(self, numbers):
        for num in numbers:
            print(num, end=" ")
        print()
```

📘 Python for C# Developers – A Comprehensive Guide


---

1. Variables & Types

C#

int x = 10;
string name = "Alice";
double pi = 3.14;
bool isActive = true;

Python

x = 10            # int
name = "Alice"    # str
pi = 3.14         # float
is_active = True  # bool

🔑 Differences

Python variables are dynamically typed → no need to declare type.

Snake_case is convention in Python, vs PascalCase/camelCase in C#.



---

2. Strings

C#

string message = $"Hello, {name}. Pi = {pi}";

Python

message = f"Hello, {name}. Pi = {pi}"

🔑 Both use string interpolation ($"" in C#, f"" in Python).


---

3. Conditionals

C#

if (x > 5) {
    Console.WriteLine("Greater than 5");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Not greater than 5");
}

Python

if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")
else:
    print("Not greater than 5")

🔑 No curly braces in Python. Indentation defines scope.


---

4. Loops

C#

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Python

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


---

5. Collections

C#

var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
var person = new Dictionary<string, string> {
    { "name", "Alice" },
    { "age", "25" }
};

Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # list
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  # dict


---

6. Functions

C#

int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

Python

def add(a, b):
    return a + b


---

7. Classes & Objects

C#

class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public Person(string name, int age) {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    public void Greet() {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, I'm {Name}, {Age} years old");
    }
}

Python

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):   # constructor
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}, {self.age} years old")

p = Person("Alice", 25)
p.greet()


---

8. Error Handling

C#

try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (DivideByZeroException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero!");
}

Python

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")


---

9. File I/O

C#

File.WriteAllText("test.txt", "Hello World");
string text = File.ReadAllText("test.txt");
Console.WriteLine(text);

Python

with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World")

with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

print(text)


---

10. Simple Use Cases

Now let’s connect this to your AI/scripting interest.

🔹 Example 1: Script to rename files

import os

for filename in os.listdir("."):
    if filename.endswith(".txt"):
        new_name = "renamed_" + filename
        os.rename(filename, new_name)
        print(f"Renamed {filename} -> {new_name}")

🔹 Example 2: Quick AI with Hugging Face transformers

from transformers import pipeline

# Sentiment analysis model
nlp = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

result = nlp("I love learning Python!")[0]
print(result)  # {'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999...}

🔹 Example 3: Data scripting with pandas

import pandas as pd

data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
print(df.describe())


---

✅ Key Takeaways

Python is simpler syntactically (no type declarations, no braces).

Everything is object-based, but with looser typing than C#.

Rich ecosystem for AI, data science, and scripting.



---

👉 Would you like me to create a step-by-step learning roadmap (with projects/exercises) that takes you from "C# dev" to "Python for AI & scripting expert"? That way you can practice progressively instead of just comparing syntax.



Perfect 👍 Let’s build you a step-by-step roadmap to learn Python as a C# developer.
Each step comes with side-by-side C# & Python snippets, explanation, and small exercises with answers so you can actually practice. At the end, I’ll add a mini-project in scripting & AI to bring everything together.


---

🚀 Python Roadmap for a C# Developer


---

Step 1: Variables & Types

📌 In Python, variables don’t need explicit types (dynamic typing).

C#

int age = 30;
string name = "Alice";
bool active = true;

Python

age = 30
name = "Alice"
active = True

✅ Exercise: Create a variable for your favorite programming language, year you started coding, and whether you still code. Print them.

Answer (Python)

language = "Python"
year_started = 2015
still_coding = True
print(language, year_started, still_coding)


---

Step 2: Strings & Interpolation

📌 Python uses f-strings.

C#

string name = "Alice";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}, welcome!");

Python

name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello {name}, welcome!")

✅ Exercise: Print "I have coded in C# for X years".

Answer

years = 10
print(f"I have coded in C# for {years} years")


---

Step 3: Conditionals

📌 Python uses indentation instead of {}.

C#

if (age >= 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}

Python

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

✅ Exercise: Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

Answer

n = 7
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")


---

Step 4: Loops

📌 Python’s range() is like a for loop in C#.

C#

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Python

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

✅ Exercise: Print all multiples of 3 from 1 to 20.

Answer

for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        print(i)


---

Step 5: Collections

C#

var nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
var person = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "name", "Alice" } };

Python

nums = [1, 2, 3]
person = {"name": "Alice"}

✅ Exercise: Create a list of 5 languages and print the second one.

Answer

langs = ["C#", "Python", "Java", "Go", "Rust"]
print(langs[1])


---

Step 6: Functions

C#

int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

Python

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

✅ Exercise: Write a function that squares a number.

Answer

def square(x):
    return x * x

print(square(5))


---

Step 7: Classes

C#

class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public void Greet() => Console.WriteLine($"Hi, I'm {Name}");
}

Python

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}")

p = Person("Alice", 30)
p.greet()

✅ Exercise: Create a Car class with brand and year, and a method info().

Answer

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.year = year

    def info(self):
        print(f"{self.brand}, {self.year}")

c = Car("Tesla", 2023)
c.info()


---

Step 8: Exceptions

C#

try {
    int x = 10 / 0;
} catch (DivideByZeroException) {
    Console.WriteLine("Error!");
}

Python

try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error!")

✅ Exercise: Catch a ValueError when converting "abc" to int.

Answer

try:
    num = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid number")


---

Step 9: File I/O

C#

File.WriteAllText("test.txt", "Hello");
var text = File.ReadAllText("test.txt");

Python

with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello")

with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()
print(text)


---

🎯 Mini Projects (Scripting & AI)


---

1. Scripting – Batch Rename Files

import os

for f in os.listdir("."):
    if f.endswith(".txt"):
        os.rename(f, "renamed_" + f)

📌 Automates file renaming, useful for scripting tasks.


---

2. AI – Sentiment Analysis

from transformers import pipeline

nlp = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
print(nlp("I love learning Python!")[0])

📌 Uses pretrained AI model to classify text sentiment.


---

3. Data Scripting – CSV Processing

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())       # first rows
print(df.describe())   # stats

📌 Powerful for data cleaning, reporting, and AI preprocessing.


---

✅ By completing this roadmap, you’ll move from C# dev → Python scripting → AI/data workflows.


---

Would you like me to expand each step into a structured 30-day learning plan (with daily practice and mini-projects), so you can steadily progress toward AI scripting mastery?





Great question 🙌 — you’re asking:
“How do I write efficient, standard Python code the way I’d do in C# (using clean patterns, conventions, and best practices)?”

Let’s break this down into key coding standards & efficiency practices, comparing C# style vs Python style so you can write Pythonic code instead of just “translated C#”.


---

📝 Writing Efficient, Standard Python (as a C# Dev)


---

1. Naming Conventions

C#: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables, methods.

Python: snake_case for variables & functions, PascalCase for classes.


✅ Example

// C#
class Car { public int ModelYear { get; set; } }

# Python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model_year):
        self.model_year = model_year


---

2. Collections & Iteration

C# way:

var nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var squares = nums.Select(n => n * n).ToList();

Pythonic way:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [n * n for n in nums]  # list comprehension

📌 Use list comprehensions instead of loops when transforming data → faster & cleaner.


---

3. LINQ vs Python Built-ins

C#’s LINQ maps to Python’s built-in functions like map, filter, sum, any, all.

C#

var evens = nums.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
int total = nums.Sum();

Python

evens = list(filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, nums))
total = sum(nums)

Or even better (Pythonic):

evens = [n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]
total = sum(nums)


---

4. Properties

Python has @property decorator instead of getters/setters.

C#

class Person {
    private int age;
    public int Age { get => age; set => age = value; }
}

Python

class Person:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self._age = age

    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age

    @age.setter
    def age(self, value):
        self._age = value


---

5. Pattern Matching / Switch

Python 3.10+ introduces match-case (like C# switch).

C#

switch(day) {
    case "Mon": Console.WriteLine("Start of week"); break;
    case "Fri": Console.WriteLine("Weekend!"); break;
}

Python

match day:
    case "Mon":
        print("Start of week")
    case "Fri":
        print("Weekend!")


---

6. Error Handling Best Practices

Always catch specific exceptions, not just general ones.

C#

try {
    File.ReadAllText("missing.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine("File missing!");
}

Python

try:
    with open("missing.txt") as f:
        data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File missing!")


---

7. Async / Await

Python’s async works very similar to C#’s.

C#

async Task FetchAsync() {
    var client = new HttpClient();
    string result = await client.GetStringAsync("https://example.com");
}

Python

import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://example.com") as resp:
            return await resp.text()

asyncio.run(fetch())


---

8. Efficiency Tips

Prefer list comprehensions over manual loops.

Use generators (yield) for large datasets.

Use with for resource management (like using in C#).

Use standard libraries (itertools, functools, collections) for performance.

Profile code with timeit or cProfile for bottlenecks.



---

9. Standard Project Structure (Pythonic)

Instead of one giant .py file (common beginner mistake), structure like:

my_project/
  ├── main.py
  ├── utils.py
  ├── models/
  │     └── person.py
  └── requirements.txt

This is similar to C# namespaces & assemblies, but simpler.


---

10. Example: Efficient & Pythonic Code

Let’s say: Get all squares of even numbers ≤ 100, sum them.

C# way

var result = Enumerable.Range(1, 100)
    .Where(n => n % 2 == 0)
    .Select(n => n * n)
    .Sum();

Pythonic way

result = sum(n * n for n in range(1, 101) if n % 2 == 0)
print(result)

📌 Python solution is short, efficient, and expressive.


---

✅ So to “code like C# but efficiently in Python,” follow Pythonic idioms:

Comprehensions instead of loops.

Built-ins instead of reinventing.

Context managers (with) for safe resource handling.

@property & decorators instead of verbose getters/setters.

PEP8 naming conventions.



---

👉 Do you want me to now build a cheat sheet of C# feature → Python equivalent (efficient version), so you can use it as a quick reference when coding?




Excellent question 👌 — this touches the heart of Python project structure, which works a bit differently than in C#.

Let’s unpack:


---

📦 Python Project Structure: main.py & requirements.txt


---

🔹 main.py

This is your entry point (like Program.cs in C#).

When you run the project, you usually start with:

python main.py

Typical usage:

Contains your main execution logic.

Often has the if __name__ == "__main__": block, which is like static void Main() in C#.



✅ Example main.py

from utils import greet

def main():
    print("Starting project...")
    greet("Alice")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

✅ Example utils.py

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

📌 Running python main.py will print:

Starting project...
Hello, Alice!

So:

main.py = entry point

Other files = helpers / modules



---

🔹 requirements.txt

Equivalent to NuGet packages in C#.

A plain text file listing dependencies your project needs.

Lets others (or you on another machine) quickly set up the environment.


Example requirements.txt

pandas==2.0.3
numpy>=1.25
transformers

📌 Each line is:

package==exact_version

or package>=min_version


Installing dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

This ensures you have the exact libraries needed.


---

🔹 How This Compares to C#

C#: You manage dependencies in .csproj using NuGet, and you have Program.cs as the entry point.

Python: You manage dependencies in requirements.txt (or pyproject.toml for modern builds), and main.py (or another file) acts as the entry point.



---

🔹 Putting It Together (Folder Example)

my_project/
│
├── main.py             # entry point (like Program.cs)
├── utils.py            # helper functions
├── models/
│   └── person.py       # class definitions
├── data/
│   └── sample.csv      # project data
└── requirements.txt    # dependencies list

Run

python main.py

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


---

👉 Would you like me to expand this into a real-world mini project structure (like a small AI app with main.py, requirements.txt, and helper modules), so you can see how everything ties together in practice?





Great question 👍 Let’s clear this up:


---

🐍 Do You Need to Install pip?

🔹 What is pip?

pip = Python’s package manager (like NuGet for C#).

It installs external libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, transformers) that are not part of the standard library.


Example:

pip install pandas


---

🔹 Do you need to install it separately?

If you installed Python from python.org (version 3.4+),
✅ pip comes pre-installed.

To check if pip is available:

pip --version

or (sometimes needed):

python -m pip --version

If it shows a version → you already have it.

If not, you can install it manually (but most modern Python setups include it).



---

🔹 When do you use pip?

If you’re only doing basic scripting (loops, files, classes), you don’t need it.

If you’re doing AI, data science, or advanced scripting, you’ll almost always need extra libraries → so pip is essential.


Example: Installing AI tools

pip install transformers torch

Example: Installing data tools

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib


---

🔹 C# Analogy

pip in Python ≈ dotnet add package or NuGet in C#.

requirements.txt in Python ≈ .csproj package references.

✅ So:

You don’t need to install pip manually if you have a modern Python (3.4+).

You will need to use pip whenever you want third-party libraries (AI, data, web apps, etc.).



---

👉 Do you want me to show you how to set up a Python environment (step-by-step, including pip, venv for isolated projects, and requirements.txt) the same way you’d set up a C# solution with NuGet packages?




Excellent question 👌 — the -m flag in Python is something you’ll see a lot, and it can feel strange coming from C#. Let’s break it down:


---

🐍 What does -m mean in Python?

-m stands for “module”.

It tells Python: run a module (a Python package or script inside the standard library or installed with pip) as if it were a script.


So instead of calling an executable directly, you call it through Python.


---

🔹 Examples

1. Running pip

Instead of:

pip install requests

You can use:

python -m pip install requests

✅ This is safer, because sometimes multiple Python versions are installed (e.g., Python 3.10 & 3.11).
python -m pip ensures you’re using pip linked to that specific Python interpreter.


---

2. Running modules directly

Python has many standard library modules you can run.

Example: Run the built-in HTTP server:

python -m http.server 8000

This starts a simple web server on port 8000.


---

3. Running your own package

Suppose your project looks like this:

my_project/
  ├── main.py
  └── utils.py

You can run it with:

python -m main

This makes Python treat it like a proper module rather than just a script file.


---

🔹 Why use -m instead of running the file directly?

Ensures you’re using the right interpreter and installed packages.

Lets you run modules without knowing the full path.

Useful when working in virtual environments (like venv).



---

🔹 C# Analogy

In C#, you usually run compiled executables (dotnet run inside a project).

In Python, you run modules using -m, which is like telling .NET:

> “Run this namespace/class as a program.”





---

✅ TL;DR:

python -m module_name = run that module with the current interpreter.

It’s safer than running executables (pip, pytest, etc.) directly.



---

👉 Do you want me to give you a cheat sheet of the most useful python -m commands (for scripting, AI, debugging, servers, etc.), so you can see when it’s best to use it?



Nice 🚀 — you’re asking “what other standard/common questions should I know as a C# developer learning Python, to feel confident and efficient?”

Let’s go through a FAQ-style guide — these are the most essential questions & answers Python learners (especially from a C# background) usually have.


---

🐍 Standard Python Questions (for C# Developers)


---

🔹 1. How do I run a Python script?

C#: You compile and run with dotnet run.

Python: No compilation needed. Just run:

python main.py

Or, run a module:

python -m module_name



---

🔹 2. Do I need a compiler?

No.
Python is interpreted, not compiled (though internally it compiles to bytecode).
Just run .py files directly.



---

🔹 3. How do I organize code into namespaces?

C#: Uses namespace.

Python: Uses modules (files) and packages (folders with __init__.py).


Example:

my_project/
  ├── main.py
  └── models/
      └── person.py

Use it like:

from models.person import Person


---

🔹 4. How do I manage dependencies?

C#: NuGet + .csproj.

Python: pip install package, track in requirements.txt.



---

🔹 5. How do I write the entry point (Main() equivalent)?

def main():
    print("Hello from Python")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

📌 if __name__ == "__main__": is Python’s way of saying
“Only run this if the file is executed directly, not imported as a library.”


---

🔹 6. How do I do async programming?

Python has async/await, similar to C#.

import asyncio

async def hello():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Hello async")

asyncio.run(hello())


---

🔹 7. Does Python have interfaces?

Not exactly.

Python uses duck typing: “If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”

For structure, use abstract base classes (ABC).


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self): pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self): return "Woof"


---

🔹 8. How do I do LINQ-like operations?

Use list comprehensions, map/filter/reduce, or pandas for advanced queries.


nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
evens = [n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]


---

🔹 9. How do I handle memory and garbage collection?

Python has automatic garbage collection like C#.

You rarely call dispose().

Use with for resource management (like using in C#).


with open("file.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()


---

🔹 10. What are Python "virtual environments"?

C#: You often use isolated solutions/projects with their own NuGet packages.

Python: You use venv (virtual environments) to isolate dependencies.


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

Now pip install affects only this project.


---

🔹 11. How do I debug Python code?

Built-in: pdb (Python Debugger).


python -m pdb main.py

IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm (similar to Visual Studio).



---

🔹 12. Does Python support generics?

Not like C#, but you can use type hints with typing module.


from typing import List

def square_all(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [n*n for n in nums]


---

🔹 13. How do I test Python code?

C#: NUnit, xUnit, MSTest.

Python: unittest (built-in) or pytest (popular).


Example with pytest:

def add(a, b): return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

Run:

pytest


---

🔹 14. What is self in classes?

Equivalent to this in C#.

Python requires it as the first parameter of methods inside classes.



---

🔹 15. What is PEP8?

The official style guide for Python code (like Microsoft’s C# coding guidelines).

Covers naming, formatting, line length, etc.

Tools like flake8 or black help enforce it.



---

✅ These are the top 15 standard questions that usually come up.
If you’re comfortable with these, you’ll already be coding in a clean, Pythonic way.


---

👉 Do you want me to now build a “C# → Python Quick Reference Table” (like a cheat sheet mapping C# features to Python equivalents), so you can look up differences instantly while coding?
